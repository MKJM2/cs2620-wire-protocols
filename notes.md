Group 1: Harrison & Henry (Table 2)
Score: 4.9/5

Functionality (2/2): 
The chat application met all core requirements. During demo day, we were shown
proof of the app operating on both localhost and over the Internet. It handled
sending, receiving, and deletion of messages without issue. The GUI, built with
Tkinter, follows a Gmail-style layout with recipient and text area fields,
along with an inbox that can be refreshed manually, but also works for live
message delivery.  Messages are visually distinguished by color based on
whether they were sent or received. The Settings tab allows the user to adjust
the displayed message count.  A nitpick is that we observed a minor delay when
sending requests through the localhost server (most likely tied to how often
the client GUI refreshes for new messages?). This is a very minor concern
however and doesn't impact functionality per se. Having to manually
refresh the inbox, while a fine design choice, isn't the best for a chat app?

Documentation (0.9/1):
The documentation is comprehensive and clear. Endpoints are explicitly defined,
and the SQLite database schema is well described. A configuration file is used
effectively,  allowing parameters such as message limits or specific protocol
magic numbers to be easily adjusted.  I liked their approach, as opposed to
just hardcoding the protocol's parameters in the implementation itself.  The
code was well documented, with docstrings and in-line comments throughout.  We
were not told during demo day what the space savings were when comparing their
JSON protocol to their custom one (nor did we see it in the documentation), so
we docked points for that.

Tests (1/1): 
We'd call the group's tests as more than adequate. We were shown a quite robust
suite of unit tests, many of which utilizing Pytest fixtures.  The tests seemed
to thoroughly validate the messaging, client/server interactions, and database
invariants (such as preventing duplicate accounts or conversations). They
systematically test for edge cases too: for example, deleting the final message
in a conversation should result in the removal of the conversation itself.  No
stress-testing the application under heavy-load was showcased, though the code
itself seemed to be designed with scalability in mind. Since the rubric
doesn't mention that as a requirement, we treated it as a nice to have,
and didn't deduct any points.

Code Clarity (1/1):
The codebase is well structured and highly readable. They use an
OOP approach, and demonstrate deep knowledge of Python (I saw multiple
instances of decorators like @classmethod).  Asynchronous I/O is managed via a
threadpool on the backend server, while synchronization is ensured through a
queue.

Group 2: Jayson & Edward (Table 2)
Score: 4.5/5 (due to minor nitpicks, see below)

Functionality (1.8/2):
The application demonstrates reliable client/server communication on both
localhost and over a network. We were shown both a GUI and CLI clients during
Demo Day.  Live message delivery worked correctly,  with a clear distinction
maintained between read and unread messages. The functionalities specified by
the problem statement were all implemented: password hashing, account creation,
account search, and deletion all perform as specified.  The Gmail-style
interface features a text field for specifying the number of unread messages,
and the CLI client supports this via an "unreadcount" command. A small nitpick
from us: during demo day no handling of edge cases was shown during the Demo
part of the showcase, but they did seem to have code handling it when we looked
at it during code review. The GUI was also slightly unintuitive and it wasn't
clear to me how to list accounts other than when trying to send a message, so
we deducted another 0.1 points for that.

Documentation (0.9/1):
Documentation is thorough and precise. A detailed wire protocol was shown to us
in a Google Doc, outlining all the op_codes used by the protocol, required
payload fields, and their descriptions. The code structure was well documented,
with docstrings throughout.  Same as the previous group, they don't specify
what the savings ratio is between the JSON protocol and their custom wire
protocol (at least not during demo day).

Tests (0.8/1):
A comprehensive test suite resides in its own /tests directory.  The tests we
saw covered a wide range of functionalitiesâ€”from client/server actions to the
messaging system and account management. While not as thourough as the first
group's we reviewed, the tests were definitely 'adequate' (see the grading
rubric's wording), which is why we only deduct a small fractional amount of
points here. Also, no stress testing for performance was showcased, similar to
the first group. If we didn't do fractional grading, we'd consider
this group to have adequate tests and assign full scores for this category.

Code Clarity (1/1):
The code is exceptionally clean and well organized. All class methods
are clearly defined and well-explained (we saw many docstrings throughout the codebase).
They show a lot of foresight with a easily replacable protocol, and supporting
version numbers in their wire protocol. They also heavily relied on OOP (e.g.,
they implement a ChatClient class and its methods like connect(), listen(), and
handle_server_response()), and all the classes and their methods are nicely
explained from within the implementation.
